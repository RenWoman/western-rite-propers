And they murmured against her.\n6 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath\n      wrought a good work on me.\n7 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will\n      ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.\n8 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint\n      my body to the burying.\n9 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached\n      throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall\n      be spoken of for a memorial of her.\n10 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief\n      priests, to betray him unto them.\n11 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give\n      him money.

Likewise also said they all.\n32 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he\n      saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.\n33 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began\n      to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;\n34 And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death:\n      tarry ye here, and watch.\n35 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and\n      prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.\n36 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee;\n      take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but\n      what thou wilt.\n37 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter,\n      Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?\n38 Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit\n      truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.\n39 And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.\n40 And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their\n      eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.\n41 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on\n      now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold,\n      the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.\n42 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.\n43 And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of\n      the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves,\n      from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.\n44 And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever\n      I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.\n45 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and\n      saith, Master, master; and kissed him.\n46 And they laid their hands on him, and took him.\n47 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant\n      of the high priest, and cut off his ear.\n48 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as\n      against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?\n49 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me\n      not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.\n50 And they all forsook him, and fled.\n51 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen\n      cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold\n      on him:\n52 And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.\n53 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were\n      assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.\n54 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the\n      high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself\n      at the fire.\n55 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness\n      against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.\n56 For many bare false witness against him, but their witness\n      agreed not together.\n57 And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him,\n      saying,\n58 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made\n      with hands, and within three days I will build another made without\n      hands.\n59 But neither so did their witness agree together.\n60 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,\n      saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness\n      against thee?\n61 But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high\n      priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the\n      Son of the Blessed?\n62 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting\n      on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.\n63 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need\n      we any further witnesses?\n64 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned\n      him to be guilty of death.\n65 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and\n      to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants\n      did strike him with the palms of their hands.\n66 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of\n      the maids of the high priest: 67 And when she saw Peter warming\n      himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with\n      Jesus of Nazareth. 68 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither\n      understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch;\n      and the cock crew. 69 And a maid saw him again, and began to\n      say to them that stood by, This is one of them. 70 And he denied\n      it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to\n      Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean,\n      and thy speech agreeth thereto. 71 But he began to curse and\n      to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak. 72 And\n      the second time the cock crew.

The Distribution Of The Palms.\n\u00b6 The blessing being thus ended, the first of the\n      Clergy that are present shall approach the Altar and give one\n      of the branches that have been blessed to the Priest. And thereafter,\n      the Priest standing before the Altar shall turn himself to the\n      People and distribute the branches, first to the Clergy singly,\n      according to their order, and lastly, to the People. And as he\n      beginneth to make distribution, the Choir shall sing the Antiphons\n      here set forth:\nThe children of the Hebrews, bearing branches of olive, went\n      out to meet the Lord, crying out and saying : Hosanna in the\n      highest.\nand this Antiphon.\nThe children of the Hebrews strawed\n      their raiment in the way and cried out saying : Hosanna to the\n      Son of David : blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord.\n\u00b6 And if these be not sufficient, they shall be repeated\n      until all the branches have been distributed.\nThen shall the Priest say:\nV. The Lord be with you.\nR.

They loose him and bring him to Jesus and put on him\n      their clothes, and set him thereon : and some spread their garments\n      in the way, others strawed branches from the trees : and they\n      that followed cried : Hosanna : blessed is he that cometh in\n      the Name of the Lord : blessed is the kingdom of our father David\n      : Hosanna, in the highest : Thou Son of David, have mercy upon\n      us.\nAnother Antiphon. St. John 12.\nWhen the people heard that\n      Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, they took branches of palm trees\n      : and went forth to meet him, and the children cried saying :\n      This is he that should come for the salvation of the people.\n      This is our salvation and the redemption of Israel.

And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.\n5 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.\n6 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.\n7 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter\u2019s field, to bury strangers in.\n8 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.\n9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;\n10 And gave them for the potter\u2019s field, as the Lord appointed me.\n11 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.\n12 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.\n13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?\n14 And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.\n15 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.\n16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.\n17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?\n18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.\n19 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.\n20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.\n21 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.\n22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.\n23 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.\n24 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.\n25 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.\n26 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.\n27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.\n28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.\n29 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!\n30 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.\n31 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.\n32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.\n33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,\n34 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.\n35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.\n36 And sitting down they watched him there;\n37 And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.\n38 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.\n39 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,\n40 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.\n41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,\n42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.\n43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.\n44 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.\n45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.\n46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\n47 Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.\n48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.\n49 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.\n50 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.\n51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;\n52 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,\n53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.\n54 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.\n\u00b6 The Creed is said.\nOFFERTORY.\nPs.\n      69.\nThy rebuke hath broken my\n      heart, I am full of heaviness: I looked for some to have pity\n      on me, but there was no man: neither found I any to comfort me:\n      they gave me gall to eat, and when I was thirsty they gave me\n      vinegar to drink.\nSECRET.\nGrant, we beseech thee, Almighty\n      God: that these gifts which we offer in the sight of thy divine\n      majesty, may obtain for us grace to serve thee in this life with\n      all godliness, and bring us in the end to everlasting felicity.\n      Through.\nPREFACE of the Cross.\nCOMMUNION.\nSt. Matt. 26.\nO my Father, if this cup may not pass away\n      from me, except I drink it: thy will be done.\nPOSTCOMMUNION.\nGrant, O Lord, that by the operation\n      of these thy mysteries, we may be cleansed from all our sins:\n      and obtain that which we have asked according to thy will.

Glory be.\nCOLLECT.\nO GOD, who hast prepared for those who love thee such good things\n      as pass man's understanding; Pour into our hearts such love toward\n      thee, that we, loving thee above all things, may obtain thy promises,\n      which exceed all that we can desire; through Jesus Christ our\n      Lord. AMEN.\nEPISTLE.\nRomans\n6:3-11\n3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus\n      Christ were baptized into his death?\n4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that\n      like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the\n      Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\n5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his\n      death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:\n6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that\n      the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should\n      not serve sin.\n7 For he that is dead is freed from sin.\n8 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also\n      live with him:\n9 Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more;\n      death hath no more dominion over him.\n10 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he\n      liveth, he liveth unto God.\n11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto\n      sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.\nGRADUAL.\nPs.\n90\nTurn thee again, O Lord,\n      at the last: and be gracious unto thy servants.
