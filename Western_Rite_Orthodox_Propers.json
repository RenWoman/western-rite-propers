And they murmured against her.\n6 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.\n7 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.\n8 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.\n9 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.\n10 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.\n11 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.\n12 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?\n13 And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.\n14 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?\n15 And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.\n16 And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.\n17 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.\n18 And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.\n19 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?\n20 And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.\n21 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.\n22 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.\n23 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.\n24 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.\n25 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\n26 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.\n27 And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.\n28 But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.\n29 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.\n30 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.\n31 But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.\n32 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.\n33 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;\n34 And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.\n35 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.\n36 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.\n37 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?\n38 Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.\n39 And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.\n40 And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.\n41 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.\n42 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.\n43 And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.\n44 And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.\n45 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.\n46 And they laid their hands on him, and took him.\n47 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.\n48 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?\n49 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.\n50 And they all forsook him, and fled.\n51 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:\n52 And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.\n53 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.\n54 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.\n55 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.\n56 For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.\n57 And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,\n58 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.\n59 But neither so did their witness agree together.\n60 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?\n61 But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?\n62 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.\n63 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?\n64 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.\n65 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.\n66 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest: 67 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth. 68 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew. 69 And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them. 70 And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto. 71 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak. 72 And the second time the cock crew.

And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.\n5 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.\n6 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.\n7 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter\u2019s field, to bury strangers in.\n8 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.\n9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;\n10 And gave them for the potter\u2019s field, as the Lord appointed me.\n11 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.\n12 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.\n13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?\n14 And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.\n15 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.\n16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.\n17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?\n18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.\n19 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.\n20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.\n21 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.\n22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.\n23 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.\n24 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.\n25 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.\n26 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.\n27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.\n28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.\n29 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!\n30 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.\n31 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.\n32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.\n33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,\n34 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.\n35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.\n36 And sitting down they watched him there;\n37 And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.\n38 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.\n39 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,\n40 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.\n41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,\n42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.\n43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.\n44 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.\n45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.\n46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\n47 Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.\n48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.\n49 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.\n50 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.\n51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;\n52 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,\n53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.\n54 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.\n\u00b6 The Creed is said.\nOFFERTORY.\nPs. 69.\nThy rebuke hath broken my heart, I am full of heaviness: I looked for some to have pity on me, but there was no man: neither found I any to comfort me: they gave me gall to eat, and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.\nSECRET.\nGrant, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that these gifts which we offer in the sight of thy divine majesty, may obtain for us grace to serve thee in this life with all godliness, and bring us in the end to everlasting felicity.
